The Pentagon has assessed that North Korea's weekend missile launch showed new capabilities, US officials told CNN on Monday.

Sunday launch The missile was launched from the Banghyon air base in North Pyongan Province on Sunday morning.

Last August North Korea test-fired what it said was a submarine-launched ballistic missile marked as a Pukguksong-1, a name which translates as "North Star." Solid fuel is like an explosive jelly, less corrosive than liquid fuel, and it can be more easily stored in the rocket's fuel tank that the liquid alternative which require specially lined tanks.

Two versions of the same missile? "While North Korean media has stated that both the Pukguksong-1 and -2 are solid-fueled, it was widely presumed that they were based on the liquid-fuelled R-27 'Zyb' Submarine Launched Ballistic Missile that was developed by the Soviet Union in the 1960s," said Karl Dewey, an expert in chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear weapons with Jane's Defence Weekly in London.

On New Year's Day, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un declared that the country had "Entered the final stage of preparation for the test launch of intercontinental ballistic missile".
