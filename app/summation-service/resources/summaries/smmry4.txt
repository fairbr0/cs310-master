The bill empowering the government to begin the formal process of leaving the European Union has reached its final stages in the Commons.

Labour's shadow business secretary Clive Lewis quit the shadow cabinet "With a heavy heart" rather than follow party orders to vote for the bill.

If passed, the European Union Bill will authorise Prime Minister Theresa May to begin Brexit talks under Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty.

Leader Jeremy Corbyn ordered his MPs to support the government's bill, whether his party's amendments are accepted or not, as he believes it would be undemocratic to ignore the will of the people, as expressed in last June's EU referendum.

Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer insisted Labour would keep "Chipping away" at the government's plans, pushing for concessions on tariff-free access to the single market and the future of the UK's tax regime.
