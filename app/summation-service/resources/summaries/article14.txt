India's space agency will attempt to launch 104 satellites from a single rocket Wednesday -- a record feat that, if successful, will cement the country's space smarts after its successful Mars orbiter mission.

In the first half of 2018, India plans to launch its second lunar mission -- in 2008, it became the fourth country to plant its flag on the moon after the US, Russia and China.

It established India's credibility as a space power and has translated into tangible economic benefits when it comes to the big business of satellite launches.

Uday Bhaskar, director at the Society for Policy Studies, a Delhi-based think tank, says India can put a satellite into space at a price that is "60% to 70% lower" than other countries.

The rocket's payload includes three Indian satellites and a 101 foreign satellites from six countries -- US, Kazakhstan, Israel, Netherlands, Switzerland and UAE, according to the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO).
