As US Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power prepares to step down from the diplomatic stage, she is offering a word of warning to President-elect Donald Trump and his team: dismiss Russian acts of aggression at your own peril.

Power, who has sparred publicly with her Russian counterpart on the UN Security Council over Moscow's annexation of Crimea, interference in Ukraine and military action in Syria on behalf of the Assad regime, said that while she hopes the next administration can expand US-Russian cooperation, it shouldn't be attempted "From the standpoint of weakness," or under what she called "Terms of appeasement." "To have historical amnesia when the stakes are this high, for us, for our shared security, for prosperity, for trade, for everything, would be a grave mistake," she said.

"Very few of the threats that we face in the 21st Century are ones that we can deal with on our own," said Power.

Over the weekend, Power opened a new Twitter account, and tweeted: "We are not going gently into the night." "I think it speaks for itself," Power said of the tweet, suggesting she and her colleagues in the Obama administration will stand up for the policies they've put in place.

"We are not going to stand on the sidelines, I think, when we see things that are making the world safer under challenge" said Power.
