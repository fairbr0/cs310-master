India's space agency will attempt to launch 104 satellites from a single rocket Wednesday - a record feat that, if successful, will cement the country's space smarts after its successful Mars orbiter mission.

"It's going to be a big deal. It shows the sophistication of India's space program," says Rajeswari Pillai Rajagopalan, head of the Nuclear and Space Policy Initiative at the Observer Research Foundation.

"Recognition of the multifaceted benefits from space exploration and space technology dates back to the Apollo program. Asian countries have been following that model and seeking those benefits ever since." India's Mangalyaan probe - Asia's first successful Mars orbiter - forced the world to take note of India's space program, which was set up in 1962.

The rocket's payload includes three Indian satellites and a 101 foreign satellites from six countries - US, Kazakhstan, Israel, Netherlands, Switzerland and UAE, according to the Indian Space Research Organization.

"The secondary satellites are often not very big so we are able to carry many of them," says Ramabhadran Aravamudan, former director of the ISRO Satellite Center in Bangalore and the author of a new book on India's space program.
