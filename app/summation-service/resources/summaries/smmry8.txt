As of early Monday, water was not flowing over the spillway, and while officials were cautiously optimistic, those hopes could "Be dashed at first light when engineers get a better look at the backup spillway. We know is tearing up the bottom of the spillway," DWR spokesman Doug Carlson told CNN. 2 spillways, 2 problems Oroville Dam is the country's tallest, and the emergency spillway that's eroding had never been used in the 48 years that the dam has existed, the DWR says.

The emergency spillway, which is an embankment covered with trees, is a last resort and was used for the first time in history on Saturday when the lake topped 901 feet, its capacity, and a light flow of water washed into the spillway.

The erosion of the emergency spillway is dangerous because "When you start to erode the ground, the dirt and everything else starts to roll off the hill," said Kevin Lawson, a CAL FIRE incident commander.

The flow of water on the emergency spillway eventually stopped Sunday night as the DWR withdrew more water from the other spillway.

The main spillway was releasing water at 100,000 cubic feet per second in an effort to reduce the amount of water traveling down the emergency spillway, authorities said.
