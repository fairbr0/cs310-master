Brexit minister David Jones said "once again" that the government recognised the issue of EU nationals' rights was "extremely important" and will address it "as a matter of priority".

Labour and some Tories had pushed for MPs to have a decisive say on the final terms, but the 326 to 293 vote meant the bill remained unchanged.

Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer insisted Labour would keep "chipping away" at the government's plans, pushing for concessions on tariff-free access to the single market and the future of the UK's tax regime.

Labour's shadow business secretary Clive Lewis quit the shadow cabinet "with a heavy heart" rather than follow party orders to vote for the bill.

Leader Jeremy Corbyn ordered his MPs to support the government's bill, whether his party's amendments are accepted or not, as he believes it would be undemocratic to ignore the will of the people, as expressed in last June's EU referendum.
