Germany's parliamentary assembly has elected Frank-Walter Steinmeier, a Social Democrat, as the country's president.

The position of president in Germany is largely ceremonial, because the chancellor is the official head of government and has a higher profile on the world stage.

"This country for many in the world has become an anchor of hope," Steinmeier said after his election.

In times like these, European unity is more important than ever, and I look forward to Germany's continued contribution to the European project," he said.

Tusk's comments alluded to Britain's decision to pull out of the 28-nation European Union and growing anti-EU sentiment in many parts of the regional bloc.
