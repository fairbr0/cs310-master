 The government's Levy Control Framework is supposed to control the cost of three low-carbon generation schemes, funded by levies on energy companies, which consumers pay for through their energy bills.

MPs have said the government must do more to demonstrate the value for money of green energy schemes which are ultimately paid for by bill payers.

"The strong, decisive action we took reduced projected costs by over Â£500m to protect people's household budgets and ensure value for money while delivering more environmentally friendly energy," added a BEIS spokesperson.

The PAC said the department "significantly underestimated" the costs of the three framework schemes.

"Government must take action to address this and also ensure customers can see clearly what they are paying towards existing and future schemes through their bills," she added.
