The "Global gag rule" imposed by Donald Trump, blocking US funds to any organisation involved in abortion advice and care overseas, could impact millions of women and girls, endangering their lives and those of their babies, Bill and Melinda Gates have warned.

The changes are expected to result in funding from the world's biggest donor to family planning and women's health programmes in the developing world being slashed.

Enabling women to time and space their pregnancies and providing access to treatment and prevention of infectious diseases is lifesaving work.

Empowering women is a key theme of the letter in which the couple argue that enabling women to access contraceptives control over the number of pregnancies they have is crucial.

"You cannot go out and be in the developing world and then come back and look at the data and turn away from the importance of women in the developing world," said Melinda Gates.
