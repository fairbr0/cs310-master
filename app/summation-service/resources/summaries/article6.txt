Ms Warren's reading was interrupted by the Senate's presiding officer, Republican Senator Steve Daines of Montana, who said she was breaking a rule that stops senators accusing each other of "unbecoming" conduct.

Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, said Ms Warren had broken Senate rules by impugning the conduct of another senator.

Ms Scott King's letter alleged that Mr Sessions was unsuitable for that role because he had "used the awesome powers of his office in a shabby attempt to intimidate and frighten elderly black voters".

Democratic US Senator Elizabeth Warren was silenced by Senate Republicans on Tuesday after reading a letter written by the widow of Martin Luther King Jr.

Ms Warren also quoted the late Senator Ted Kennedy, who called Mr Sessions a "throwback to a shameful era".
