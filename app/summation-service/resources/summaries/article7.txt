The Trump administration has prepared a new executive order that would extinguish regulatory controls designed to prevent US companies profiting from and encouraging the spread of "conflict minerals" that are inflaming violence in Congo.

A draft executive order, composed last week and obtained by the Guardian, proposes a two-year suspension of a portion of the Dodd-Frank financial reforms that requires US firms to carry out due diligence to ensure that the products they sell include no minerals mined in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or neighboring countries.

Perhaps anticipating an outcry from human rights groups, the draft order says that it will replace the regulatory efforts of Dodd-Frank with a new plan to tackle human rights violations and the funding of armed groups in the Congo.

The group added: "This law helps stop US companies funding conflict and human rights abuses in the Democratic Republic of Congo and surrounding countries.

Global Witness, which for years has investigated the role of mining in fuelling violence in eastern Congo, said that were the draft executive order put into effect it would be a "gift to companies wanting to do business with the criminal and the corrupt".
