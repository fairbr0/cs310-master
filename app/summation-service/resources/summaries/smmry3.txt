Russia's main opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, has been found guilty of embezzlement and handed a five-year suspended sentence.

Mr Navalny's rise as a force in Russian politics began in 2008 when he started blogging about alleged malpractice and corruption at some of Russia's big state-controlled corporations.

Mr Navalny plans to dispute that law as a violation of Russia's constitution.

At the start of the verdict on Wednesday, judge Alexei Vtyurin said the court had established that Mr Navalny had "Organised" the theft.

Mr Navalny is likely to only serve 18 months of the five-year suspended sentence because the judge has taken into account time served from the previous sentence before the ECHR ruling, his lawyer told journalists.
