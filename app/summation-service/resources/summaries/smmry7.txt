Democratic US Senator Elizabeth Warren was silenced by Senate Republicans on Tuesday after reading a letter written by the widow of Martin Luther King Jr. The 30-year-old letter criticised Jeff Sessions, President Donald Trump's nominee for attorney general.

Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, said Ms Warren had broken Senate rules by impugning the conduct of another senator.

Ms Warren's reading was interrupted by the Senate's presiding officer, Republican Senator Steve Daines of Montana, who said she was breaking a rule that stops senators accusing each other of "Unbecoming" conduct.

Jeff Sessions dogged by racism claims Jeff Sessions: 'Southern racist caricature painful' What is this rule? Under Rule 19, members of the Senate are not allowed to "Directly or indirectly, by any form of words impute to another Senator or to other Senators any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming a Senator".

"I've been appalled at the way Democrats have treated Jeff Sessions." Senator Elizabeth Warren, 67, is the darling of America's liberal left, many of whom have urged her repeatedly to run for the presidency.
