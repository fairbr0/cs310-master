Europe needs to open up legal routes for African migrants to work on the continent if it is serious about cutting deaths in the Mediterranean, according to a senior UN figure.

"The main reason for irregularity of movement into Europe is the fact that legal channels to come to Europe are basically non-existent," he told the Guardian.

"If you want to try to fulfil a very legitimate aspiration, such as having a decent livelihood, and you cannot find that back at home, but you can find that in Europe, the only way to try to get that decent livelihood is to get into Europe irregularly, because legal channels are not available. So that is something that needs to expand." He stressed this did not mean unlimited, open borders.

The IOM chief argued that Europe could not manage migration without opening up legal routes, because many people are desperate to work in Europe.

In 2016, the IOM helped more than 81,000 people return from Europe to their birth country, a 45% increase on the previous year.
