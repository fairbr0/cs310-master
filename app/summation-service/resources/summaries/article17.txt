Gates and his wife spoke out as they published a progress letter to Warren Buffett, the businessman who 10 years ago invested a large part of his fortune in the couple's foundation, which has at its centre the mission to save children's lives.

The "global gag rule" imposed by Donald Trump, blocking US funds to any organisation involved in abortion advice and care overseas, could impact millions of women and girls, endangering their lives and those of their babies, Bill and Melinda Gates have warned.

The couple write of the progress that has been made in saving children's lives, particularly through immunisation and vaccine development, and the work that lies ahead in making childbirth safer and tackling malnutrition.

When women have a gap of at least three years between births, their children are more likely to survive and be healthy and well educated, the couple say.

Empowering women is a key theme of the letter in which the couple argue that enabling women to access contraceptives control over the number of pregnancies they have is crucial.
