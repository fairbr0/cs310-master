It was a retrial of the original 2013 case - and another five-year suspended sentence - that was quashed by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), which said he was not given a fair hearing.

Mr Navalny is likely to only serve 18 months of the five-year suspended sentence because the judge has taken into account time served from the previous sentence before the ECHR ruling, his lawyer told journalists.

Mr Navalny plans to dispute that law as a violation of Russia's constitution.

Russia's main opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, has been found guilty of embezzlement and handed a five-year suspended sentence.

Mr Navalny was allowed to stand as a candidate for the mayoralty of Moscow despite his suspended sentence in 2013.
