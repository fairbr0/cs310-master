Entry to the US for nationals of seven Muslim-majority countries has been stopped for 90 days by Donald Trump.

The two Iraqi refugees detained in New York, one of whom had worked as a US Army interpreter, were in transit when the executive order was signed on Friday.

A cap of 50,000 refugees in 2017 - less than half of the upper limit under Mr Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama.

In response to Mr Trump's order, the United Nations refugee agency said the needs of those fleeing conflict had never been greater.

Mr Trump said the measures detailed in his executive order would "Keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the US". But rights groups say there is no link between Syrian refugees in the US and terrorism.
