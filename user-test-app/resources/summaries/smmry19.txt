The stock surge, pushing Apple above a $700 billion market cap again, comes amid renewed optimism for the iPhone.

Apple's previous high was set six months after it released the redesigned iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, kicking off what CEO Tim Cook described as the "Mother of all upgrades." Since then Apple has bucked its tradition of overhauling the iPhone every other year.

Apple's annual sales fell in the 2016 fiscal year for the first time since 2001 as iPhone sales, still the majority of its business, declined in three consecutive quarters.

Apple sales started growing again in the December quarter, driven by stronger demand for the iPhone - particularly for the larger and more expensive iPhone 7 Plus.

Despite Trump clashing with Apple during the campaign, investors are now optimistic Apple will benefit from at least one Trump proposal: cutting taxes on cash that U.S. businesses bring back from their overseas accounts.
