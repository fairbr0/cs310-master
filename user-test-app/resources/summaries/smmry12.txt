Germany's parliamentary assembly has elected Frank-Walter Steinmeier, a Social Democrat, as the country's president.

Steinmeier previously served as vice chancellor and foreign minister under current Chancellor Angela Merkel.

Steinmeier, 61, has been a vocal critic of US President Donald Trump.

Steinmeier also expressed concerns about Trump's comments that NATO, the political and military alliance between North America and Europe, is obsolete.

European Council President Donald Tusk sent his congratulations to Steinmeier.
