MPs have said the government must do more to demonstrate the value for money of green energy schemes which are ultimately paid for by bill payers.

The influential Public Accounts Committee said it was promised in 2014 an annual report on the impact of these policies on energy bills.

The government's Levy Control Framework is supposed to control the cost of three low-carbon generation schemes, funded by levies on energy companies, which consumers pay for through their energy bills.

The three schemes are: The "Renewables obligation", which requires energy suppliers to either meet targets for buying a proportion of their energy from low-carbon generators, or pay a fee for any shortfall.

"The strong, decisive action we took reduced projected costs by over Â£500m to protect people's household budgets and ensure value for money while delivering more environmentally friendly energy," added a BEIS spokesperson.
