The Trump administration has prepared a new executive order that would extinguish regulatory controls designed to prevent US companies profiting from and encouraging the spread of "Conflict minerals" that are inflaming violence in Congo.

A draft executive order, composed last week and obtained by the Guardian, proposes a two-year suspension of a portion of the Dodd-Frank financial reforms that requires US firms to carry out due diligence to ensure that the products they sell include no minerals mined in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or neighboring countries.

International aid groups working with the Congolese victims of conflict minerals - such as blood diamonds and the mining of coltan that is widely used in mobile phones and other tech gadgetry - have lashed out at the proposal, saying that far from being a humanitarian measure it would embolden armed groups and the unscrupulous businesses in cahoots with them.

The conflict minerals law, first reported by Reuters, seeks to help stop mineral trading that inflames violence in Central Africa.

Last year the House of Cards star Robin Wright launched a new campaign involving both Congolese and US activists designed to put a spotlight on the trade in conflict minerals and to try and stem the practice.
