Entry to the US for nationals of seven Muslim-majority countries has been stopped for 90 days by Donald Trump.

During the election campaign, Mr Trump suggested a "total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on".

In response to Mr Trump's order, the United Nations refugee agency said the needs of those fleeing conflict had never been greater.

Mr Trump said the measures detailed in his executive order would "keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the US".

Mr Trump signed the order on Friday, which was International Holocaust Remembrance Day.
