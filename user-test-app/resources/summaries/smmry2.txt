US President Donald Trump has taken a swipe at "So political" courts, as his immigration travel ban faces a major legal test.

"We have to give you the weapons that you need," he told police chiefs, "And this is a weapon that you need and they're trying to take it away from you, maybe because of politics or maybe because of political views." Also on Wednesday morning, Mr Trump criticised retailer Nordstrom after it decided not to stock the new clothing line of his daughter, Ivanka Trump.

In Tuesday's hearing, the San Francisco-based 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals posed tough questions at those challenging and defending Mr Trump's travel ban.

The court must decide whether Mr Trump acted within his authority or violated the US Constitution's prohibition on laws favouring one religion over another, as well as anti-discrimination laws.

The 9th Circuit is expected to rule on whether a lower court judge in Seattle - whom Mr Trump described as a "So-called judge" - acted properly last Friday in temporarily halting enforcement of the president's order.
