British political parties have approached the surveillance agency GCHQ for advice on beefing up their internet security after a cyber-attack during the 2015 UK general election and the hacking in the US last year of the Democratic party.

Ciaran Martin, head of the UKâ€™s National Cyber Security Centre, which is part of GCHQ and was officially opened on Tuesday, confirmed informal contact had been made by the parties and that he expected to be asked formally to provide advice on how to increase their digital security.

Asked about concerns over interference in the British political system by potential hacking of political parties, Martin said: "So what I would say is that protecting the integrity of the electoral democratic systems is up there with the top priorities.

But it is not just a question of something happens to the Democratic National Committee, therefore we look at the corporate networks of British political parties.

"You have to look at the totality of this," he said, adding that it was not just about the security of the parties but the political system as a whole.
