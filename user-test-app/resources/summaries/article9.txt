At a summit in Malta last week, European leaders promised to step up work with Libya, the main country of departure for migrants, while acknowledging that the chaos and limited writ of the countryâ€™s UN-backed government makes the task difficult to achieve.

In 2016, the IOM helped more than 81,000 people return from Europe to their birth country, a 45% increase on the previous year.

Europe needs to open up legal routes for African migrants to work on the continent if it is serious about cutting deaths in the Mediterranean, according to a senior UN figure.

The IOM chief argued that Europe could not manage migration without opening up legal routes, because many people are desperate to work in Europe.

He said the plan, which includes a role for the IOM in helping 6,000 migrants return from Libya to their country of origin, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa, was incomplete.
